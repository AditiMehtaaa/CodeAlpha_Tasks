# Stock Price Prediction
Took stock price of Tesla and predicted its price by using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks. 

First of all, what are Long Short-Term Memory networks? 
They are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, which is a challenge in traditional RNNs on Long sequences of data. The vanishing gradient problem occurs when the gradients used to update the weights of the network during training diminish as they propagate backwards through time, making it difficult for the network to learn long-range dependencies in sequential data.
LSTM are especially designed to overcome this issue by introducing a memory cell that can maintain information over long periods of time, allowing them to capture dependencies over many small steps.

Now to approach the problem using Long Short-Term Memory networks for stock price prediction for Tesla's Dataset. Here's how we could approach:

1. **Data Collection**: obtain historical stock price data of the company. We can use various financial data APIs like Yahoo Finanace, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl, even github repositories, and Kaggle platform to retrieve this data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: -Clean the data: Handle missing values, if any.
                           -Normalize the data: Scaling the data to a range (commonly between 0 and 1) to improve model performance.
                           -Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Engineer some features that could potentially improve the model's performance.
4. **Model Building**: -Construct an LSTM model.
                       -Define the architecture of the LSTM network, including the number of layers, activation function, etc
                       -Compile the model, specifying the loss function (often mean squared error for regression tasks) and the optimizer (such as Adam).
                       -train the model using the training data. this involves feeding the input sequences into the model and adjusting the weights based on the error between the predicted and actual values.
5. **Model Evaluation**: -Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE),etc.
                         -Visualize the predicted values against the actual values to see how well the model is performing.
6. **Fine-Tuning**: -Depending on the model performance, we may need to fine-tune hyperparameters auch as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, etc
                    -We can alsoexperiment with different architectures, adding dropout layers for regularization, or using bidirectional LSTMs.
7. **Prediction**: Once satisfied with the model's performance, we can use it to make predictions on future or unseen data.
